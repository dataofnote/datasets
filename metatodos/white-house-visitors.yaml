    As part of President Obama's commitment to government transparency, we are providing records of White House visitors on an ongoing basis online. In December 2009 we began posting all White House visitor records for the period from September 15th onwards under the terms of our voluntary disclosure policy. In addition, as part of our new policy, we post records dating from January 20th that are specifically requested on an ongoing basis. For more information, read the White House blog post announcing the new policy.
