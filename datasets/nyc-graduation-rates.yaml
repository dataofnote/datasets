title: NYC Graduation Rates
slug: nyc-graduation-rates
description: |
    The New York State graduation rate calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005). The cohort consists of all students who first entered ninth grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2005 entered ninth grade in the 2005-2006 school year). Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. When available, graduation rates as of both June and August (including summer graduates) are reported.
