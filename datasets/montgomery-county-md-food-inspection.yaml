description: |
    The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures.
