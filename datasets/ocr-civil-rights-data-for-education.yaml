    The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) collected data about key education and civil rights issues for the 2013-14 school year from virtually every public school in the country through the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).

    The CRDC collects a variety of information including, student enrollment and educational programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency and disability.  For more general information about the CRDC (including past and future collections), visit the CRDC home page.
