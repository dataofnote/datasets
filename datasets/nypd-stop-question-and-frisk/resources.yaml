     RAND's analysis found that Hispanic and black pedestrians were stopped at a disproportionate rate but could not find conclusive evidence that it was related to systemic racial bias. The NYPD provided records for the year 2006, including a field that contained unique identifiers for officers that allowed for analysis of patterns for each officer, but that field is not part of the dataset released to the NYCLU's later FOIL request.

    concerned about how the public was being served. To document his concerns, he began
    carrying around a digital sound recorder, secretly recording his colleagues and
    superiors. He recorded precinct roll calls.

    An analysis by the NYCLU revealed that innocent New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since 2002, and that black and Latino communities continue to be the overwhelming target of these tactics. Nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent, according to the NYPD’s own reports:

    The widespread practice of stopping residents for what was deemed “suspicious” behavior, often called “stop-and-frisk,” was the defining tactic of the New York Police Department for a decade, pursued in the face of intensifying protests and dwindling crime, has now all but vanished.

    We investigate by analyzing three million stops in New York City over five years, focusing on cases where officers suspected the stopped individual of criminal possession of a weapon...we demonstrate that by conducting only the 6% of stops that are statistically most likely to result in weapons seizure, one can both recover the majority of weapons and mitigate racial disparities in who is stopped. We show that this statistically informed stopping strategy can be approximated by simple, easily implemented heuristics with little loss in efficiency.

    A review of hundreds of street stops by the New York Police Department last year found that in over one-quarter, officers failed to document the suspicion that prompted them to stop someone for questioning. In most instances, sergeants signed off on the stop-and-frisk paperwork even when the forms filled out by officers omitted required information.
